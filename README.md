## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Figma design reference

### What I learned

#### Areas to improve upon
+ Improve organization within css code
+ Working with layout needs improvement
+ Git and github workflow

#### What I did good
+ Comfortable with basic html and css syntax
+ Didn't quit
+ Replicated the project's design goal well

***My craft and skills _will_ come together with experience... stay _consistent and persistant!_***

### Continued development

Completing one FrontendMentor challenge per day side by side with Codecademy frontend career path course is my goal for now!

### Useful resources
